I am one person who values effort or hard work and I believe that one has to put in effort to attain any goal in life whether long term or short term, I am also a big fan science because it helped me comprehend the things that are happening around me better and the perplexities of life from atoms to planets helped me to acknowledge the precision and perfection of God. I am a person who loves to seek knowledge whenever possible because it helps me understand certain events or mysteries and changes happening spontaneously or involuntary around me.<br>
			I come from a very supportive family, they all support my decisions and sometimes they even go an extra mile in making an environment that is conducive for me to continue studying by means financial and physical support. My mother and my Aunt are the ones who I appreciate the most because they make a lot of sacrifices for me to be happy and reach my targets. Subsequently, they smoothen the rough path just so that I can unleash my full potential as am still in progress of following my dreams and fulfillingâ€™s Godâ€™s ultimate plan which he has for me. I will forever be grateful for that .Moreover I have a big brother who is always on my side in every decision I make. He usually gives the best advices and tries to support me every way he can. </p>
