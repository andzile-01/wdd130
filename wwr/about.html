        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          Water rafting, an exhilarating adventure sport, has its roots in both necessity and exploration. Its history is intertwined with the development of human societies and the natural landscapes they inhabit.<br>
        
          Ancient Beginnings<br>
          
          The origins of water rafting can be traced back to ancient civilizations, where humans utilized logs and reeds to navigate rivers for trade, transport, and exploration. Archaeological evidence suggests that the Egyptians used wooden boats on the Nile as early as 400 BCE, while the ancient Greeks navigated their rivers in small craft. These early forms of rafting were primarily functional, designed for transport rather than recreation.<br>
          
          The Evolution of Rafting<br>
          
          As societies evolved, so did their relationship with water. The early 19th century marked a pivotal moment when rafting began to take on recreational aspects. The American West, with its vast and untamed rivers, became a playground for adventurous explorers and settlers. The famous Lewis and Clark expedition (1804-1806) showcased the potential of river travel in uncharted territories, igniting interest in upstream exploration.<br>
          By the mid-19th century, the California Gold Rush brought an influx of people to the West, many of whom relied on rivers for transportation. This era saw the emergence of wooden rafts, constructed from logs, as practical vessels for navigation. Rafting as a leisure activity began to gain popularity, particularly as a means to escape the rigors of pioneering life.<br>
          
          The Birth of Modern Rafting<br>
          
          The modern concept of whitewater rafting emerged in the mid-20th century. In 194, the first inflatable raft was developed by a scientist named John E. Warner, who created a lightweight, portable vessel primarily for scientific research. This innovation paved the way for recreational rafting. In 1962, a group of college students in Colorado organized the first commercial rafting trip on the Colorado River, marking the birth of commercial whitewater rafting as a recognized industry.<br>
          During the 197s, rafting gained momentum as an adventurous sport, with the establishment of various rafting companies offering guided tours. The formation of the American Whitewater Affiliation in 1954 further legitimized the sport and advocated for river conservation.<br>
          
          The 198s and 199s: A Surge in Popularity<br>
          
          The 198s and 199s saw a surge in popularity for rafting as an extreme sport. Major rivers like the Grand Canyon, the Salmon River in Idaho, and the Gauley River in West
